// Package mcp implements a Model Context Protocol server that lets Claude Code
// (or any MCP client) interact with a running sortie daemon over its Unix
// socket. The server speaks MCP over stdio and exposes task lifecycle
// management: creating, listing, retrying, advancing, and editing tasks,
// managing dependencies, listing workflows, and reading task state.
// Irrecoverably destructive operations (delete, revert, cleanup) are not
// exposed.

// registerTools wires the public tool surface. Keep this list aligned with
// the package promise: no irrecoverably destructive operations (delete_task,
// revert_task, cleanup).
//
// create_tasks_and_wait and wait_for_tasks are intentionally additive: they
// spawn children and gate the caller's own step, but never delete, stop, or
// retry foreign tasks. They mutate task_waits_on edges only, which the engine
// clears automatically on the parent's resume.
//
// update_step_context is included even though it mutates DB state because the
// daemon enforces strict safety constraints: it only writes to the task's
// currently-active step (verified against tasks.current_step AND task_steps
// row status), and it cannot affect any other task. It cannot delete data,
// stop agents, or retry/revert tasks. The worst-case is that an agent
// overwrites its own in-flight context — recoverable by re-running the step.
//
// retry_task, update_task_description, list_tasks, and
// update_task_dependencies were added as an explicit design decision
// (task #217) to let orchestrating agents manage the task lifecycle. All are
// recoverable mutations: retry_task stops the task's own agent and re-queues
// it (no work is deleted — worktree and branch survive; a from-step retry
// preserves earlier step contexts), description and dependency edits are
// plain re-editable DB updates, and list_tasks is read-only. Task deletion,
// revert, and worktree cleanup remain off the surface.
//
// advance_task is an explicit design decision to let a Claude Code session
// signal "this tmux step is done" from outside the tmux pane (the in-pane
// signal is the step-done sentinel file). The daemon only accepts it for
// tasks in tmux state, and no work is deleted: the workflow either resumes
// at the next step or runs the same finalization the TUI's advance/finalize
// keybind triggers. If it advanced too early, retry_task re-runs the step.
