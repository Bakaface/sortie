// Repo represents a git repository rooted at a known path on disk. Methods
// scoped to the main working tree (merges, branch management, worktree
// lifecycle) are called directly on Repo with no path argument; methods
// scoped to a specific task worktree take that worktree's path explicitly,
// since one Repo can have many worktrees checked out under it at once.
//
// Repo is a thin wrapper — it holds no file handles or cached state beyond
// the root path, so constructing one is cheap and callers are free to build
// a fresh Repo per call site rather than threading a shared instance.
