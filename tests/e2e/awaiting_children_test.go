// awaitChildrenWorkflowYAML defines two workflows used by TestAwaitingChildrenSuspendsAndResumes:
//
//   - parent: a one-step "spawn-and-wait" workflow whose stub hook spawns two
//     child tasks via `sortie create -w child` and registers waits-on edges via
//     `sortie wait-for-tasks --use-env`. The hook is gated by a marker file so
//     only the FIRST step run spawns children; the resume run finds the marker
//     and does nothing.
//
//   - child: a one-step trivial workflow used by the spawned children.
//
// We use on_complete: commit (not merge) so finalization is single-step and we
// don't need to coordinate per-task branch names across the bundle.
