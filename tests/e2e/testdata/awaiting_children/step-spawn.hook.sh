# step-spawn.hook.sh — simulates an agent that calls create_tasks_and_wait.
#
# First invocation (parent's initial run of the spawn step):
#   1. Create two child tasks via `sortie create -w child`
#   2. Register waits-on edges via `sortie wait-for-tasks --use-env`
#   3. Touch a marker file so subsequent invocations skip the spawn
#
# Second invocation (parent's resume run after children completed):
#   The marker file exists, so the hook is a no-op. The engine's wait-on
#   probe finds zero edges → step completes normally → parent advances.
#
# This separation (marker file gates the spawn) is essential — without it,
# every step run would create two more children and the parent would never
# escape the awaiting-children state.

# the SORTIE binary that the e2e harness exposed through PATH-like wiring.
